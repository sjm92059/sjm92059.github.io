     <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> .I am originally from Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It was always a dream of mine to play football professionally. 

      I have played football ever since I was twelve years old. I was always too big to play in the recreational leagues because they had weight classes and

      being taller and bigger than most middle school age kids I did not make the cut. That is until my family moved us to the little town of Barnegat, New Jersey.

      There in 2008 I got my first taste of football. I was hooked instantly. </P>
	 <p> I came to the University of Georgia in 2015 along with twnety seven other enrollees. 
     Below is a table with some data.  </p>
